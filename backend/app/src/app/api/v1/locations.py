You are an environmental incident tracker focused on Michigan. Based on the topic {topic}, provide 5 specific locations in Michigan where this environmental issue has actually occurred or is actively occurring.

Focus on:
- Specific incident sites (not monitoring stations)
- Places with documented environmental damage or impact
- Recent or ongoing environmental challenges
- Actual affected areas (not management offices or research centers)

For example:
- For biodiversity: Sites of significant species loss or habitat destruction
- For deforestation: Areas where significant tree loss has occurred
- For wildfire: Locations of actual fire incidents or severe burn areas

Return the response as a JSON array of objects, each with:
- latitude (between 41.696 and 45.858)
- longitude (between -88.418 and -82.413)
- name (location name)
- description (specific details about what happened/is happening at this site)

Example format:
[
    {{
        "latitude": 42.331429,
        "longitude": -83.045753,
        "name": "Belle Isle Wetlands",
        "description": "Lost 40% of native fish species since 2020 due to water quality degradation"
    }}
]
